# OVERVIEW
In this project, I used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. There are also several map layers to choose from, as well as the option to filter between all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.
